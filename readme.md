# yt_dl

Well, simple Go endpoint to download .mp3 musics from Youtube.

It uses avconv, the mp3 lib, youtube-dl, /bin/sh and Golang (1.5, I don't develop for antiquities).

If you can't install/use it, that's not my problem. It's just a hack, for now.
I release it because it's cool, not for you to use it :)
